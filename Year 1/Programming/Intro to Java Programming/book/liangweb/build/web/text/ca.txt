Parliament on October 22, 1964 and was proclaimed into law 
by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (the Queen of Canada) on 
February 15, 1965. The Canadian Flag (colloquially known 
as The Maple Leaf Flag) is a red flag of the proportions
two by length and one by width, containing in its center a
white square, with a single red stylized eleven-point
mapleleaf centered in the white square.
