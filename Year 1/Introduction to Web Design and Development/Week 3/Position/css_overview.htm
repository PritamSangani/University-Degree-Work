	<h2>Overview(CSS)</h2>
	<p>CSS is a style-sheet language.  It is used to describe how documents that use markup should be presented.  It is mostly used to style HTML and XHTML documents, but it can also be used to style XML documents.  The primary role of CSS is to enable HTML document content to be separated from document presentation.  This makes the HTML documents more accessible.</p>

    <p>CSS provides much more flexibility and control in styling HTML pages than HTML formatting markup provided.  Many HTML pages can share the same CSS document so that styling information no longer needs to be repeated in every page.  You create different style sheets for different uses, such as on-screen, in print, for text-to-speech converters, etc.</p>

    <p>A style sheet is essentially a list of rules.  Each rule incudes one or more 'selectors', and a block of declarations.  Each declaration includes a 'property' and a 'value'.  The selectors tell the browser which part(s) of the HTML document a particular style should be applied to.</p>

    <p>CSS is continually evolving, and with each new release, new features are added.  The CSS specification is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium.  The latest version is CSS3.</p>
