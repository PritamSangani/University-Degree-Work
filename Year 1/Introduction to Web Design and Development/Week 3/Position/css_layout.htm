<h1>CSS Layout</h1>

<p>Tables are considered obsolete for layout, in favour of CSS. CSS layout has important advantages over table layout. It requires relatively little code, which results in smaller file sizes and faster downloads. Less code also makes the page easier to update and maintain. Also, pages that use CSS for layout can adjust better to the size of the user's display. Tables don't wrap, so viewing a table-based layout on a small screen can require lots of horizontal scrolling, which is not good for the user.</p>

<p>Also, CSS is more accessible for blind users, who use screenreaders that read out the content of an HTML document. It would be extremely distracting if the screen reader keeps announcing which table row and column you're in. This is irrelevant information for the user.  A CSS-based layout eliminates this problem.</p>

<p>There are a variety of methods used to create different layouts in CSS. You can use 'floats', 'positions', 'margin' settings and so on to tell the browser where to place each element of your page. More complex layouts can be more difficult to get right, especially if you want them to look the same across a range of different browsers. This is a particular problem when new CSS features are introduced. It takes time before new versions of browsers to be released that deal with new features more consistently. Until new elements become web standards, you often have to use different code to make them work across different browsers.</p>
