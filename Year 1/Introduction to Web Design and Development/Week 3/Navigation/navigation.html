      <h2>Web Usability</h2>

      <p>Web usability is about making your site easy for people to use: Is information easy to find? Are features easy to find? Is the navigation easy to understand? Is the process of buying goods clear and easy? Is it easy to register as a user? Can you easily recover a lost password?</p>
      <p>Good standards of usability help to keep users on your site. Designers and developers need to remember that there are likely to be numerous other websites offer the same or a similar service, so if your site's usability is poor, visitors can easilty click to another site.</p>

      <h2>Web Accessibility</h2>
      <p>Web accessibility is about designing your website so that people with disabilities can have, as far as possible, the same experience when using your website as a person with no disabilities. It can include visual, auditory, physical, cognitive and neurological disibilities.</p>
      <p>Under the 'Disability Discrimination Act 1995' Part III (Access to Goods &amp; Services), there is a legal requirement on business to make their websites accessible. An accessible web can help people with disabilities participate more actively in society.</p>
