\section*{Discussion}
Going through the portfolios using the 5 languages discussed in this report, I have gained an understanding of different programming principles and added more tools to my toolbox which I can use if I have to program in one of these languages during my career. I would like to learn and gain more experience in functional programming and I would like to gain experience in programming in Scala as I have attended a couple of workshops during hackathons where financial companies, in particular, have talked about the benefits of programming in Scala.
