\begin{abstract}
\noindent This short report will cover a critical comparison of the features of Pharo, Ruby, JavaScript, Clojure and Haskell. It will also cover the key concepts and nuances of each language that have been learnt by completing the laboratory exercises and portfolios. This report will start off by individually describing the features of each of the above languages before doing an overall comparison using a number of categories to compare against. The next section of this report will provide a personal evaluation and reflect on the structure of each of the programming languages studied, before ending the report with a brief discussion on how studying and working with the principles of these languages will help in furthering a career in software development.
