\section*{Hypotheses}

From the research question above, I propose that the following hypotheses could be derived from my research:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{H\textsubscript{0} - it is not possible to add long-term memory to a chatterbot, at this stage, which is convincing enough to be comparable to human memory mechanism.}
	\item \textbf{H\textsubscript{1} - it is possible to add convincing long-term memory at a significant statistical level, if the number of participants in the research is high enough.}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Note:} The degree of convincingness would be determined by the analysis of conversation log files, to see how often the memory mechanism appeared to access what the user was referring to, and by a subjective analysis of a questionnaire put to the participants of a research experiment.
