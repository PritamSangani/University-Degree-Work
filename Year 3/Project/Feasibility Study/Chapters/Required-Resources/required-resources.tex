\section*{Required Resources}
The resources required to carry out this research project is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A laptop or PC capable of smoothly running:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Python 3.x 
		\item Google Chrome
		\item PyCharm - an IDE, by JetBrains, to write and compile Python code
		\item Visual Studio Code - an IDE to write code in any programming language (HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this project)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
All resources listed above are all available to download for free. (Note: PyCharm has a paid version, but, for the scope of this project, the free community edition will suffice.) Furthermore, I will not be relying on the University Laboratory PCs as I can run all required resources on my personal laptop.
