\section*{Problems}
As with any project, problems can arise and it is important to resolve them quickly. To mitigate the effect of problems during this project, I am considering the problems that could arise and how I would overcome each problem.\\\\
Firstly, a problem that is likely to occur is in the implementation of the product. As I have not worked with Natural Language Processing before, I am likely going to have some trouble, initially, implementing the Named Entity Recognition algorithms. To resolve any issues in implementation, I will first look at the documentation for any modules I use. If this does not solve the problem, I can use sites, such as Stack Overflow, to search for possible solutions.\\\\
A second problem, that is not likely to occur but could still occur, is that my code could be lost, either by my laptop becoming corrupt or stop working. To mitigate this problem, I will use a version control system called Git and I will host my code on GitHub, which is a cloud-based storage service for code repositories.
