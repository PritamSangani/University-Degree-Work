\section*{Evaluation}
As with all projects of this nature, an evaluation of the produced software must be undertaken. I intend to do this by running an experiment where participants would converse with the chatterbot for two sessions. There will be two sessions as this project involves implementing long-term memory. Therefore, in order for the participant to properly evaluate the quality of the chatterbot, in particular its ability to retrieve information from previous conversations, I would need the participant to have two sessions with the chatterbot. Once the participant has concluded the experiment, I would have them answer a questionnaire to gauge their responses and feelings about the chatterbot's quality. I would then subjectively analyse the responses, as well as, look at the conversation logs to determine the degree of convincingness of the chatterbot.
