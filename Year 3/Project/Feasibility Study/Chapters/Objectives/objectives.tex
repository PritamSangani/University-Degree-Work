\section*{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}
The problem is a complex one to be solved and so I have broken the problem down into small steps and approaches that I will take to solve the problem. These are as follows: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Complete a Literature Review by reading research papers and articles on the topic of Natural Language Processing and Named Entity Recognition from the Internet and textbooks.
	\item Find source code for the ELIZA chatterbot in Python and start understanding how the code works.
	\item Compare the different tools for Named Entity Recognition readily available for use in Python.
	\item Design an overview of the software and a plan to implement.
	\item Implement the software according to the plan, whilst incrementally testing where appropriate.
	\item Carry out a final testing of the software.
	\item Evaluate the quality of the software by carrying out a study with participants.
	\item Write up the research findings in a report.
\end{enumerate}
As well as the objectives listed above there are a number of interim deliverables that need to be met. These are as follows: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prototype Report
	\item Prototype Software
	\item Final Software
	\item Report Outline
	\item Showcase Event
	\item Final Report
\end{enumerate}
