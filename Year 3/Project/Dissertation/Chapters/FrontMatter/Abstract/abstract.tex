       This project will look at how a long-term memory network can be implemented in the ELIZA chatterbot. To do this a literature review was done in the areas of long-term memory, chatterbots and Natural Language Processing. Named Entity Recognition was found to be a useful field to look at during this project, because of the way it can extract key pieces of information, such as names of people, from textual data. A product was implemented to test the hypotheses defined at the start of this project and an evaluation was held with participants at the end of the implementation phase. However, it was found that there were some shortcomings in the dialogue management area of the project, but Named Entity Recognition was evaluated to be a useful technique in extracting key pieces of information that people are likely to talk about.\\\\
